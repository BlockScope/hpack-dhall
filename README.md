# hpack-dhall: Dhall support for Hpack

This package allows you to use the [Dhall configuration
language](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell) to specify Haskell
packages.


There is no documentation, but if you are familiar with both 
[Hpack](https://github.com/sol/hpack) and Dhall then using `hpack-dhall` should
be a breeze.  If not take a look at the following resources:

- The [`package.dhall`](https://github.com/sol/hpack-dhall/blob/master/package.dhall) in this repository
- The [Dhall tutorial](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall/docs/Dhall-Tutorial.html)
- The [Hpack documentation](https://github.com/sol/hpack#readme)
